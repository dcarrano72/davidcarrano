            <h1 class="mainh1">About me</h1>

            <p>I am an artist and web developer with many years of experience with illustration and using graphics
                software and code
                editors to create digital art and code for interactive web graphics and user interface design.</p>

            <p>My interest in art and technology started early. I started drawing as a kid and exceled. When I was very
                young I got my
                first computer. It was a TRS 80 Mc-10 running BASIC on ROM. I followed the instructions to program my
                first dice game
                and I was hooked. Around the same time, I got my first airbrush and started painting t-shirts. I loved
                how fast you I could
                represent
                shading and depth. I began doing drawings and painting projects for people here and there.</p>

            <p>I continued doing freelance art projects here and there over the years while working other jobs. I got
                hired at a
                Broadway scenic studio where I learned backdrop painting</p>

            <p>In 1998 I started working for an internet company doing digital image editing. Then I bought my first
                graphics computer
                system. There I started experimenting with creating animations in Flash. I began learning action script
                to create
                interactivity for my animations. To display my flash projects, I started building html pages and
                embedding flash files. I continued building websites for myself and occasionally for small businesses
                and in 2009 I started
                building websites
                full time. In 2019 I graduated from General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. Now I am a
                freelance web developer living in Shelton CT. where I study programming and build
                websites for
                small businesses and personal projects.</p>
